# Reference: Manifest schema for Microsoft Teams

The Microsoft Teams manifest describes how the app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [`https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.5/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json`]( https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.5/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json). Previous versions 1.0-1.4 are also supported (using "v1.x" in the URL).

The following schema sample shows all extensibility options.

}
```

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

*Optional, but recommended* &ndash; String

The https:// URL referencing the JSON Schema for the manifest.

## manifestVersion

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the manifest schema this manifest is using. It should be "1.5".

## version

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the specific app. If you update something in your manifest, the version must be incremented as well. This way, when the new manifest is installed, it will overwrite the existing one and the user will get the new functionality. If this app was submitted to the store, the new manifest will have to be re-submitted and re-validated. Then, users of this app will get the new updated manifest automatically in a few hours, after it is approved.

If the app requested permissions change, users will be prompted to upgrade and re-consent to the app.

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## id

**Required** &ndash; Microsoft app ID

The unique Microsoft-generated identifier for this app. If you have registered a bot via the Microsoft Bot Framework, or your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft, you should already have an ID and should enter it here. Otherwise, you should generate a new ID at the Microsoft Application Registration Portal ([My Applications](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)), enter it here, and then reuse it when you [add a bot](~/concepts/bots/bots-create.md).
If you are submitting an update for your exisitng app, the ID in your manifest must not be modified.

## permissions

**Optional**

* `identity` &emsp; Requires user identity information
* `messageTeamMembers` &emsp; Requires permission to send direct messages to team members

Changing these permissions when updating your app will cause your users to repeat the consent process the first time they run the updated app. See [Updating your app](~/publishing/apps-publish.md#updating-your-app) for more information.

## devicePermissions

**Optional** Array of Strings

Specifies the native features on a user's device that your app may request access to. Options are:

* `geolocation`
* `media`
* `notifications`
* `midi`
* `openExternal`

## validDomains

**Optional**, except **Required** where noted

A list of valid domains for websites the app expects to load within the Teams client. Domain listings can include wildcards, for example `*.example.com`. This matches exactly one segment of the domain; if you need to match `a.b.example.com` then use `*.*.example.com`. If your tab configuration or content UI needs to navigate to any other domain besides the one use for tab configuration, that domain must be specified here.

It is **not** necessary to include the domains of identity providers you want to support in your app, however. For example, to authenticate using a Google ID, it's necessary to redirect to accounts.google.com, but you should not include accounts.google.com in `validDomains[]`.

Teams apps that require their own sharepoint URLs to function well, may include {teamsitedomain}.sharepoint.com in their valid domain list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not add domains that are outside your control, either directly or via wildcards. For example, `yourapp.onmicrosoft.com` is valid, but `*.onmicrosoft.com` is not valid.

The object is an array with all elements of the type `string`.

## webApplicationInfo
